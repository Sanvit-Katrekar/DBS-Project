# DBS-Project
A basic Campus Management System for our DBS project

Using MySQL and Angular with NodeJS

This project aims to create a simple campus management system that maintains:
1. Library
2. Canteen
3. Hostel
4. Academics

Integration with master database complete, needs testing.

To run the queries manually one-by-one, run the .sql script files

For automatic database queries import the .sql files from `Exported Databases` folder
